Notes
Cousin has coordinates already, but he's so goddamn cocky that he leaves a copy for you, "just so you can stick around to see my inevitable victory."
Cousin has ausar mercenary by the name of Dane.
Dane has albino skin, white hair and fur, red eyes
Four arms - Dane is one of very few with the motor skills to independently use all of them for different tasks.
Dane has a tentacle dick that can extend up to 9' in length, studded with knots about every six inches.
Uses two high caliber pistols and a two electrified blades.
[Win] Cousin leaves dane to stall, picks him up after driving the PC back with a strafe from his gunship
[Lose] Dane violates the PC then hops on the gunship.
