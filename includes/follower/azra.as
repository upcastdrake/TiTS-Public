* https://e621.net/post/show/394399/anthro-areola-avian-balls-big_breasts-black_lips-b
* 9' tall - Obscenely tall for a Suula. Sure we couldn't do 8'? Not going to fit in most ships very well.
* 47 yrs old
* Long, prehensile tongue.
* curvy body with wide, childbearing hips etc - Pure Minerva is a good template
* "Massive bouncy funbags, G-cups or bigger"
* Start out as G-cups, become J during pregnancy, M after birth.
* Lactate permanently after first preggomancy. 
* Big dick - Just a hair under Kiro length but fatter around the middle.
* Overproductive balls. Glans and balls massively sensitive as a result of some dallying with Throbb.
* Produces pre very easily. Might provide fun play opportunities.
* Very sensitive siren cunt (filled with small wigglers - aphrodisiacs). Super sensitive clit. Bigger tendrils near entrance. Very elastic, doesn't ever really gape. Very wet.
* Cock tentacles can aphrodisiac sting, causes genital swelling and increased cum volume. (Assuming she can control this as an at will thing. Might be fun to play with).
* PHEREOMONES: Fertile/ready. Musky/heady balls&dong, especially when preggo. Cunt is more fragrant esp when preggo/horny.
* Azra just 'tastes' heavenly - clearly modded with some amazing xeno flower DNA to lend her pheromones an exotic floral hint and a taste of sweet, ambrosia, maybe a hint of peach for full mineva reference.
* Needs to be Kina's Siren race, obviously.

Personality Notes:
* Responsible single mom who successfully keeps her enhanced libido in check with sheer force of will. Sweet & slutty in the sheets, serious on the streets (with a hint of lovey-dovey).
* Supposed to be kind of a switch. Dommy side should probably very lovy-dovey and a lil milfy.
* Prefers taking vaginal over using her dick.
* Polyamorous
* Womb "belongs" to the PC, her "stud". Will orgy/threesome if condoms/contraception are used.
* History/Jorb
* Single mom after her ex died in a pirate raid. Raised her kids by herself. VERY close with her daughters (who I think Savin would rather have be blank slates to give him some freedom, but I'll leave that between you guys). So they're already sort of incestual. After things are serious with the mom, daughters can come visit if parked on Tavros and bang?
* Xenobiologist looking for a crew to take her out to rush planets. Specializes in unique flora (plants) and finding potentially useful adaptations for mods. Has contacts in both JoyCo and Xenogen that she can sell stuff to.
* Has an apartment on the residential deck where her daughters presently live.
 
Romancing/Recruiting the sharkMILF!
* Recruits herself the first time you introduce yourself! Warm and friendly but nonsexual at first.
* Requests your assistance with gathering samples on Mhen'ga, Tarkus, and Myrellion. Results in a gauntlet of 3 to 4 combat encounters. If you lose, she runs off and you're left in the wilderness of the planet by yourself. Have to go back to your ship to restart.
* Each success makes her more affectionate and causes her to open up more talk discussions.
* 1st: hug and kiss that she then apologizes for. All blushy and shy about it afterward. Doesn't want to do more.
* 2nd: Passionate kissing after. Apologizes again but wants more and kisses you mid apology. Has enough self-control to pull herself back but pheromones leave the PC wanting it baaaad.
* 3rd: Boning back on the ship. Explicitly declares you as her stud and in a moment of passion begs you to knock her up.
* 3rd if nocock: Bones your butt, trying to talk you into getting a dick so you can do things to her. If PC declines, puts her in "sad" state where she doesn't really want much to do with you. Perks up the moment you come back with dick.
* If sexy-times are unlocked and PC ever shows up sans dick, visibly disappointed and not interested in sexytimes. May offer the PC a throbb on a huge cooldown to "fix" them.
